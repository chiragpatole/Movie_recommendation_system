# Movie_recommendation_system

I have created a movie recommendation system using PYTHON.
There are basically two types of recommendation system content based filtering and collaborative_based filtering. 
and I have covered both of them in my project.

I have downloaded the data from kaggle. There are namely four datasets movies_metadata.csv , ratings.csv, credits.csv and Keywords.csv.

You can download all csv files from this link- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oklhRWsfmsMVwA4PgQ3ZLFmPGnkYo-KZ?usp=sharing
